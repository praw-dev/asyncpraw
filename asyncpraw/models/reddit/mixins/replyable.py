        :returns: A :class:`.Comment` or :class:`.Message` object for the newly created
            comment or message or ``None`` if Reddit doesn't provide one.

        :raises: ``prawcore.exceptions.Forbidden`` when attempting to reply to some
            items, such as locked submissions/comments or non-replyable messages.

        A ``None`` value can be returned if the target is a comment or submission in a
        quarantined subreddit and the authenticated user has not opt-ed into viewing the
        content. When this happens the comment will be successfully created on Reddit
        and can be retried by drawing the comment from the user's comment history.

        Example usage:

        .. code-block:: python

            submission = await reddit.submission("5or86n", fetch=False)
            await submission.reply("reply")
