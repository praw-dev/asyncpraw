Reddit\\u2019s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we\\u2019ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. \\n\\n**What happened?**\\n\\nOn June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees\\u2019 accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. \\n\\nAlthough this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.\\n\\nNow that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.\\n\\n**What information was involved?**\\n\\nSince June 19, we\\u2019ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:\\n\\n* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**\\n   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site\\u2019s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit\\u2019s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.\\n   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you\\u2019re clear here.

Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs.

We\\u2019ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback.

Specifically, we\\u2019ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now\\u2019s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament\\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee will [vote on changes](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44412025) to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:\\n\\n* **Article 11** would create a \\\"link tax:\\u201d Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees\\u2014 pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit. \\n* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\\\\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.

As a result of this big flaw, the law\\u2019s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.\\u003Cbr/\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELuckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJulia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/\\\"\\u003Ean AMA on the subject\\u003C/a\\u003E.

The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\\n\\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\\n\\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU\\u0026sh=a9c7a036) last week.

I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\\n\\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\\n\\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\\n\\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\\n\\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors.

The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\\n\\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\\u2014up to an outright ban.\\n\\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.

When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \\u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\\u201d\\n\\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \\n\\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\\n\\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\\n\\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \\n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \\n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\\n\\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\\n\\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\\n\\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\\u2019s done for us over the years.\\n\\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\\n\\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\\u20132006, our idealistic \\u201cpolicy\\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \\u201cpolicy.\\u201d \\n\\nI left Reddit from 2010\\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \\n\\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \\u201cmaking Reddit worse\\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \\n\\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\\n\\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \\u201cBreaking Reddit\\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\\n\\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \\n\\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\\n\\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nSteve\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_1w72\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 19, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we\\u2019re going from here\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": null, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_gxas21\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.54, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 40076, \"total_awards_received\": 128, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": null, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 40076, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"self\", \"edited\": false, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 4, \"gid_2\": 19, \"gid_3\": 5}, \"post_hint\": \"self\", \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1591412687.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETL;DR: We\\u2019re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"/u/kn0thing\\\"\\u003Eu/kn0thing\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cstrong\\u003Ehas resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor.

I\\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nIt\\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\\u2019s annual transparency report.\\n\\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\\n\\n## By the numbers\\n\\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\\n\\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\\n\\n* In 2019, we removed **\\\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\\n\\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\\n\\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\\n\\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\\n\\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We\\u2019ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.\\n\\n**Where do I vote?**\\n\\nYour polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state\\u2019s elections office ([find yours here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.\\n\\nThere are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what\\u2019s on the ballot in your area.

Today, all Reddit users have the option to enable [two-factor authentication](https://i.redd.it/2y66bw0sapb01.gif) for an additional layer of account security.\\n\\nWe have been [slowly rolling this feature out](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7bfoqg/twofactor_authentication_now_available_for/), starting with beta testers, moderators, and third-party app developers, to ensure a positive experience across devices. Your feedback has been incredibly valuable, from pointing out bugs to recommending features. Thank you to everyone involved in testing.\\n\\nTwo-factor adds more security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. In this case, if you opt into 2FA, you\\u2019ll access a 6-digit verification code generated by your phone after a new sign-in attempt.\\n\\nWith two-factor enabled, even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you.\\n\\nYou can enable two-factor by selecting the [password/email](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/) tab under your preferences on desktop. Select **enable** under _two-factor authentication_ and follow the steps given to you. And make sure to generate your backup codes in the event your phone is unavailable! You can find more help in our [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication).\\n\\nTwo-factor is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party apps. It requires an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or any app supporting the TOTP protocol) to generate your 6-digit verification code.\\n\\nA few handy security reminders:\\n\\n* Choose a strong and unique password.

In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x\\u2026) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.\\n\\nSpeaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.\\n\\nPrepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics\\u2019.

Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.\\n\\nWe did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, \\\"Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied.\\\" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.\\n\\nLastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts!

mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it\\u2019s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.\\n\\nGiven the recent news, we\\u2019d like to share some of what we\\u2019ve learned:\\n\\nWhen it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.\\n\\nOn the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don\\u2019t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.\\n\\nAs for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015\\u20132016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.\\n\\nThe final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\\\\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\\\\_GOP\\u2019s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.\\n\\nI wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it\\u2019s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It\\u2019s up to all of us\\u2014Redditors, citizens, journalists\\u2014to work through these issues. It\\u2019s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we\\u2019re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.\\n\\nThank you for reading. While I know it\\u2019s frustrating that we don\\u2019t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries.

We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGiven the recent news, we\\u2019d like to share some of what we\\u2019ve learned:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don\\u2019t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy\\\"\\u003Ead policies\\u003C/a\\u003E prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015\\u20132016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN_GOP\\u2019s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it\\u2019s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It\\u2019s up to all of us\\u2014Redditors, citizens, journalists\\u2014to work through these issues. It\\u2019s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we\\u2019re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThank you for reading. While I know it\\u2019s frustrating that we don\\u2019t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003C!-- SC_ON --\\u003E\", \"likes\": null,

Popular.**\\n\\n \\nMany years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), \\u201cthe defaults\\u201d.  \\n\\nOver the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations.

platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.\\n\\nThank you all for contributions to r/downtimebananas.\\n\\n**Impact**\\n\\nOn Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system. \\n\\nNo data was lost.\\n\\n**Cause and Remedy**\\n\\nWe use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. \\n\\nPart of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn\\u2019t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.\\n\\nAt 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to \\u201cdown mode\\u201d while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance.

This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo data was lost.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECause and Remedy\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPart of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn\\u2019t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to \\u201cdown mode\\u201d while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance.

We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).\\n\\nWe\\u2019re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it\\u2019s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.\\n\\nReddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.\\n\\nOn the product side, we have a lot going on. It\\u2019s incredible how much we\\u2019re building, and we\\u2019re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We\\u2019re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can\\u2019t wait for you all to see what we\\u2019re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we\\u2019re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn\\u2019t supported by all browsers, doesn\\u2019t work on mobile, and is implemented by few\\u2014if any\\u2014advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don\\u2019t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.\\n\\nOur Community, Trust \\u0026 Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we\\u2019re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).\\n\\nWhile there is plenty more to report, I\\u2019ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I\\u2019ll be here a couple hours.\\n\\n\\u2013Steve\\n\\nu: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions!

Thank you again for \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/\\\"\\u003Emaking your voice heard\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe\\u2019re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it\\u2019s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EReddit has \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian\\\"\\u003Eclosed another round of funding\\u003C/a\\u003E. This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn the product side, we have a lot going on. It\\u2019s incredible how much we\\u2019re building, and we\\u2019re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We\\u2019re creating more \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/\\\"\\u003Egeo-specific\\u003C/a\\u003E views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can\\u2019t wait for you all to see what we\\u2019re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We\\u0026#39;ll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we\\u0026#39;ll see where the feedback takes us from there.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe\\u2019re making some changes to our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy\\\"\\u003EPrivacy Policy\\u003C/a\\u003E. Specifically, we\\u2019re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn\\u2019t supported by all browsers, doesn\\u2019t work on mobile, and is implemented by few\\u2014if any\\u2014advertisers, and replacing it with our own \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/personalization\\\"\\u003Eprivacy controls\\u003C/a\\u003E. DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we\\u0026#39;re adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don\\u2019t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOur Community, Trust \\u0026amp; Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we\\u2019re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/\\\"\\u003Ecommunity traffic\\u003C/a\\u003E numbers to be more accurate).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile there is plenty more to report, I\\u2019ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I\\u2019ll be here a couple hours.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u2013Steve\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003Eu: I\\u0026#39;ve got to run for now. Thanks for the questions!

announcement](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html) regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.\\n\\n* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.\\n* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.\\n* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.\\n* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).\\n\\nMost (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:\\n\\n* 3% (4) had negative karma\\n* 33% (47) had 0 karma\\n* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma\\n* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma\\n* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma\\n\\nTo give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.

While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran\\u2019s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.\\n\\nThrough this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we\\u2019ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.\\n\\nWe believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity.

technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.\\n\\nOver the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.\\n\\nThe changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all\\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.\\n\\nMany people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years\\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. \\n\\nInterestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes.

This results in more variety in \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/all\\\"\\u003Er/all\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMany people will ask if this is related to \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E over the years\\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInterestingly enough, \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E was already getting downvoted out of \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/all\\\"\\u003Er/all\\u003C/a\\u003E yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/EnoughTrumpSpam\\\"\\u003Er/EnoughTrumpSpam\\u003C/a\\u003E was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\\u2019s Reddit for you. \\u00af\\\\_(\\u30c4)_/\\u00af \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit\\u2014let\\u2019s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let\\u2019s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESteve\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003Eu: I\\u0026#39;m off for now.

ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we\\u2019re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).\\n\\n## First, a quick recap\\n\\nSince our last post, here\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve been doing:\\n\\n* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).\\n* **We held policy calls with mods**\\u2014both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate\\u2014and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.\\n   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.\\n* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today\\u2019s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit\\u2019s community governance).\\n\\nFrom our conversations with mods and outside experts, it\\u2019s clear that while we\\u2019ve gotten better in some areas\\u2014like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)\\u2014we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.\\n\\nThese include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\u2019s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\\n\\n## New Policy\\n\\nThis is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here\\u2019s what\\u2019s different:\\n\\n* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.\\n* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\\n   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\\n* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.\\n   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.\\n* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.\\n\\nAlongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.\\n\\nAll communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we\\u2019ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users\\u2014through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.\\n\\nThough smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\\n\\nTo be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit\\u2014but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.\\n\\n## Our commitment\\n\\nOur policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.\\n\\nBut just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today\\u2019s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.\\n\\nEdit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_1w72\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 9, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Update to Our Content Policy\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": null, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_hi3oht\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.5, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 19536, \"total_awards_received\": 168, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": null, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 19536, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"self\", \"edited\": 1593565818.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 6, \"gid_2\": 9, \"gid_3\": 10}, \"post_hint\": \"self\", \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1593478806.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/\\\"\\u003EA few weeks ago\\u003C/a\\u003E, we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate.

AMA!\\n\\n### Hi everyone!\\n\\nI\\u2019m Alex\\u2013I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I\\u2019m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.\\n\\n### Who are you?\\n\\nI work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I\\u2019ve been a Redditor for eight years and it\\u2019s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. \\n\\nIn my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).\\n\\n### What\\u2019s New?\\n\\nWhen I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans\\u2014there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We\\u2019ve made progress on many fronts since I\\u2019ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we\\u2019ve been working on for a long time:\\n\\n1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. \\n2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.\\n\\nBuilding our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.\\n\\nRevamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We\\u2019ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We\\u2019re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone\\n\\nSo here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click\\u0026publisher_id=294177\\u0026site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click\\u0026publisher_id=294177\\u0026site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we\\u2019ve built for you.\\n\\n### What\\u2019s Next\\n\\nThis is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we\\u2019ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we\\u2019ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.\\n\\nPlease give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We\\u2019d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).\\n\\nI\\u2019ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!\\n\\nThanks!  \\nAlex\\n\\n**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team \\u2013 we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.\\n\\n**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day.

latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team\\u2019s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\\\\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.\\n\\nFirst, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\\\\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don\\u2019t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop\\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\\u0026arh=2\\u0026w=960\\u0026s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \\\\(You\\u2019ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\\\\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\\\\) \\n\\nWe also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \\\\(Montagna\\\\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \\\\(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\\\\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \\\\(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\\\\).\\n\\nI\\u2019d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I\\u2019ve mentioned before that we\\u2019re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we\\u2019re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:\\n\\nIn my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I\\u2019d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: \\n\\n* 70\\u0026#37; \\\\(662\\\\) had zero karma\\n* 1\\u0026#37; \\\\(8\\\\) had negative karma\\n* 22\\u0026#37; \\\\(203\\\\) had 1\\\\-999 karma\\n* 6\\u0026#37; \\\\(58\\\\) had 1,000\\\\-9,999 karma\\n* 1\\u0026#37; \\\\(13\\\\) had a karma score of 10,000\\\\+\\n\\nOf the 282 accounts with non\\\\-zero karma, more than half \\\\(145\\\\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust \\u0026 Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\\\\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation\\u2014all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\\\\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\\\\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. \\n\\nTo give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.\\n\\nWe still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\\\\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust \\u0026 Safety and Anti\\\\-Evil teams are working. It\\u2019s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.\\n\\nWe know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading.

Reddit is evolving!\\n\\nReddit is not a one\\\\-size\\\\-fits\\\\-all experience. It\\u2019s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:\\n\\n* Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit\\n   * [Give communities tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) that are simple, intuitive, and flexible\\u2014for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.\\n* Make our desktop experience more welcoming\\n   * Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice \\\\(e.g., different viewing options: [Card](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) / [Classic](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) / [Compact](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif)\\\\) and familiarity to all users.\\n* Design a foundation for the future\\n   * Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.\\n* Keep content at the forefront\\n   * We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.\\n\\n# Asking Reddit\\n\\nAs we moved from setting high\\\\-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look\\\\-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It\\u2019s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:\\n\\n* Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a \\u201chamburger menu\\u201d on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and [filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters](https://i.redd.it/1is6htgra3j01.gif).\\n* Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts \\\\(aka \\u201cCreate a post\\u201d\\\\) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you\\u2019re creating.\\n* Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We\\u2019ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved \\\\(e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic\\\\), and we\\u2019re working on shipping fixes.\\n\\nThe list of user\\\\-inspired changes goes on and on \\\\(and we\\u2019re expecting a lot more *i*teration as we expand our testing pool\\\\), but this is how we\\u2019ve worked through design challenges so far.\\n\\n# It\\u2019s [never over](https://media.giphy.com/media/fQvND2Wo28q9a/giphy.gif)\\n\\nThe redesign isn\\u2019t finished at \\u201cGA\\u201d \\\\(General Availability, or as I like to call it, \\u201cTime to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work\\u201d\\\\).

bullying policy so we can be more responsive to your reports. \\n\\nHey everyone, \\n\\nWe wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding content that [threatens, harasses, or bullies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), which you can read in full [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). \\n\\n**Why are we doing this?**\\nThese changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be \\u201ccontinued\\u201d and/or \\u201csystematic\\u201d for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn\\u2019t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.\\n\\nThe changes we\\u2019re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. \\n\\nWe also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.\\n\\n**How will these changes work in practice?**\\nWe all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we\\u2019re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we\\u2019re hoping today\\u2019s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we\\u2019ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. \\n\\nYou should also know that we\\u2019ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don\\u2019t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won\\u2019t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. \\n\\nAs with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our [response times have improved significantly since the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/), but we\\u2019re always striving to move faster.

Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be \\u201ccontinued\\u201d and/or \\u201csystematic\\u201d for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn\\u2019t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe changes we\\u2019re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow will these changes work in practice?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\nWe all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we\\u2019re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we\\u2019re hoping today\\u2019s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we\\u2019ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EYou should also know that we\\u2019ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don\\u2019t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won\\u2019t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/\\\"\\u003Eresponse times have improved significantly since the start of the year\\u003C/a\\u003E, but we\\u2019re always striving to move faster.

Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\\n\\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \\n\\nSpeaking of bans, you\\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust \\u0026 Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\\n\\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.\\u0026hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, we\\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \\n\\nIncluding but not limited to\\u2026 night mode, user \\u0026 post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\\n\\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance.

[***live***](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/fdh4rr/announcing_our_partnership_and_ama_with_crisis/fkbzsmv)\\n\\nHi Mods,\\n\\nAs we all know, Reddit provides a home for an infinite number of people and communities. From awws and memes, to politics, fantasy leagues, and book clubs, people have created communities for just about everything. There are also entire communities dedicated solely to finding someone to talk to like r/KindVoice and r/CasualConversation. But it\\u2019s not all funny memes and gaming\\u2014as an anonymous platform, Reddit is also a space for people to express the most vulnerable parts of themselves.\\n\\nPeople on Reddit find help in support communities that address a broad range of challenges from quitting smoking or drinking, struggling to get pregnant, or addressing abuse, anxiety, depression, or thoughts of suicide. Even communities that don\\u2019t directly relate to serious topics can get deep into serious issues, and the person you turn to in a time of need may be someone you bonded with over a game, a shared sense of humor, or the same taste in music.\\n\\nWhen you see a post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming. Especially if you\\u2019re a moderator in that community, and feel a sense of responsibility for both the people in your community and making sure it's the type of place you want it to be.\\n\\nHere at Reddit, we\\u2019ve been working on finding a thoughtful approach to self-harm and suicide response that does a few key things:\\n\\n1. Connects people considering suicide or serious self-harm with with trusted resources and real-time support that can help them as soon as possible.\\n2. Takes the pressure of responding to people considering suicide or serious self-harm off of moderators and redditors.\\n3. Continues to uphold our high standards for protecting and respecting user privacy and anonymity.\\n\\nTo help us with that new approach, today we\\u2019re announcing a partnership with [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) to provide redditors who may be considering serious self-harm or suicide with free, confidential, 24/7 support from trained Crisis Counselors.\\n\\nCrisis Text Line is a free, confidential, text-based support line for people in the U.S. who may be struggling with any type of mental health crisis. Their Crisis Counselors are trained to put people at ease and help them make a plan to stay safe. If you\\u2019d like to learn more about Crisis Text Line, they have a helpful [summary video of their work](https://www.crisistextline.org/) on their website and the complete story of how they were founded was covered in-depth in the [New Yorker article, *R U There?*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/r-u)\\n\\n**How It Will Work**\\n\\nMoving forward, when you\\u2019re worried about someone in your community, or anywhere on Reddit, you can let us know in two ways:\\n\\n1. Report the specific post or comment that worried you and select, *Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm.*\\n2. Visit the person\\u2019s profile and select, *Get them help and support.* (If you\\u2019re using Reddit on the web, click *More Options* first.)\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll reach out to tell the person a fellow redditor is worried about them and put them in touch with Crisis Text Line\\u2019s trained Crisis Counselors. Don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll have some rate-limiting behind the scenes so people in crisis won\\u2019t get multiple messages in short succession, regardless of the amount of requests we receive. And because responding to someone who is considering suicide or serious self-harm can bring up hard emotions or may be triggering, Crisis Text Line is also available to people who are reporting someone. This new flow will be launching next week.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what it will look like:\\n\\n\\u0026#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h5gpnc26pk41.png?width=375\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=e3af1518a61ffbc2f5d001db5fce32b57ab41256\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9205nrc26pk41.png?width=375\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=de45d0e3d76239f45c8ab61c4230be3b28f0981d\\n\\nAs part of our partnership, we\\u2019re hosting a joint AMA between Reddit\\u2019s group product manager of safety u/jkohhey and Crisis Text Line\\u2019s Co-Founder \\u0026 Chief Data Scientist, Bob Filbin u/Crisis_Text_Line, to answer questions about their approach to online suicide response, how the partnership will work, and what this all means for you and your communities.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a little bit more about Bob:As Co-Founder \\u0026 Chief Data Scientist of Crisis Text Line, Bob leads all things data including developing new avenues of data collection, storing data in a way that makes it universally accessible, and leading the Data, Ethics, and Research Advisory Board.

lot](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-passwords-idUSKCN0XV1I6) of [recent password dumps](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/then-there-were-117-million-linkedin-password-breach-much-bigger-than-thought/) made available on the parts of the internet most of us generally avoid.  With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.  \\n\\nThough Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are *reusing passwords between sites*.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:\\n\\n * Choose a [strong, **unique** password](https://xkcd.com/936/).  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean \\\"use that really good password you use on sites you care about.\\\"  I mean [\\\"one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!\\\"](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/)   [Password reuse is really bad!](https://xkcd.com/792/)  We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that *other* site you use the same password on who decides not to use [bcrypt](https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) but rather a [nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!](https://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/)\\n * [Set and verify an email address](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.\\n * [Check your own account activity page!](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity)  If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to [change your password](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.\\n\\nOn a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in *for several years*.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password \\\"hunter2\\\". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q**: *But how do I make a unique password?*\\n\\n**A**: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known [heuristics](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/11/passwords_are_not_br.html).  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]\\n\\n**Q**: *What's with the fear mongering??*\\n\\n**A**: [It's been a rough month.](https://i.redd.it/ua725p02cizw.jpg) Also, [don't just take it from me this is important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc)\\n\\n**Q**: *Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?*\\n\\n**A**: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if *we* get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a [huge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit\\u0026hl=en) [ecosystem](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8) [of](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader\\u0026hl=en) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8), including our newly released [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage\\u0026hl=en) clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  \\\"Adding 2FA to the login flow\\\" will require a lot of coordination.\\n\\n**Q**: *Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!*\\n\\n**A**: Please. Stop.

[We\\u2019ve recently updated](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/6c9a28e6bd0cebc05e220b6d807b4bf46663474b) its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the \\u201cBlock User\\u201d button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.

discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.\\n\\n\\nI'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.\\n\\n\\nAlso, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.\\n\\n\\nWith that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.\\n\\n\\nA very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.\\n\\n\\nWhen the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.\\n\\n\\nThat same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.\\n\\n\\nThe decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.\\n\\n\\nIn the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. \\n\\nLater that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.\\n\\nThis nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.\\n\\n\\nAs the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. \\n\\nMeanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.\\n\\nSo, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?\\n\\n\\nThe answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.\\n\\nQ: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!\\n\\nA: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.\\n\\n\\nQ: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!\\n\\nA: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.\\n\\nWe have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!\\n\\nA: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.\\n\\n\\nQ: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?\\n\\nA: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!\\n\\nA: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.\\n\\n\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_3zbwm\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 22, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Time to talk\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": null, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_2fpdax\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.59, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 14403, \"total_awards_received\": 23, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": null, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 14403, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"self\", \"edited\": 1410093090.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 1, \"gid_2\": 22}, \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1410104977.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EAlright folks, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/\\\"\\u003Ethis discussion\\u003C/a\\u003E has pretty obviously devolved and we\\u0026#39;re not getting anywhere.

Why are we sending out a message about how we\\u0026#39;re being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe answer is probably not satisfying, but it\\u0026#39;s the truth, and the only answer we\\u0026#39;ve got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We\\u0026#39;d execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/rules\\\"\\u003Esite rules\\u003C/a\\u003E, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It\\u0026#39;s obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow, after all of the context from above, I\\u0026#39;d like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find \\u003Cem\\u003Esome\\u003C/em\\u003E of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I\\u0026#39;ll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQ: You\\u0026#39;re only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can\\u0026#39;t force anyone to believe this of course, you\\u0026#39;ll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQ: Why aren\\u0026#39;t you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: We remove what we\\u0026#39;re required to remove by law, and what violates any \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com\\\"\\u003Erules\\u003C/a\\u003E which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html\\\"\\u003Eblog post\\u003C/a\\u003E speaks very well to this.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe have banned \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/TheFappening\\\"\\u003E/r/TheFappening\\u003C/a\\u003E and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQ: You\\u0026#39;re doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I\\u0026#39;m sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it\\u0026#39;s just not there.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQ: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: We take down what we\\u0026#39;re required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQ: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven\\u0026#39;t figured out yet and that I\\u0026#39;d welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we\\u0026#39;re going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don\\u0026#39;t hold this stance because we\\u0026#39;re money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat\\u0026#39;s all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it\\u0026#39;s very late and I\\u0026#39;ve written this in urgency. I\\u0026#39;ll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003C!-- SC_ON --\\u003E\", \"likes\": null, \"suggested_sort\": \"qa\",

When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.\\n\\nAs Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit\\u2014or at least say on our public pages\\u2014in the spirit of our mission.\\n\\nThese types of content are prohibited [1]:\\n\\n * Spam\\n * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)\\n * Publication of someone\\u2019s private and confidential information\\n * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say \\\"I don't like this group of people.\\\" It's not ok to say, \\\"I'm going to kill this group of people.\\\")\\n * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]\\n * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors\\n\\nThere are other types of content that are specifically classified:\\n\\n * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.\\n * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.\\n\\nWe've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don\\u2019t pollute people\\u2019s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor\\u2019s listings, and we think it\\u2019ll work for this other type of content as well. \\n\\nNo company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We\\u2019ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don\\u2019t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it\\u2019s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.\\n\\n[1] This is basically what we have right now.

In general, \\\\*these\\\\* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we\\u2019re replacing are no longer available \\\\(RIP redditmade and reddit.tv\\\\), we\\u2019ve created a more [robust API process](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), and we\\u2019ve launched [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/)!\\n* **European data protection law.**  Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation \\\\(GDPR\\\\).

We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise \\\\(like the Copyright, DMCA \\u0026 Takedown section in the User Agreement\\\\), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy \\\\(e.g., \\u201cdon\\u2019t mess with Reddit\\u201d in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on \\u201cBreaking Reddit\\u201d in the content policy\\\\).\\n\\nOur work won\\u2019t stop at new terms and policies.

talked a lot about our desktop redesign\\u2014[why we\\u2019re doing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/), [moderation/styling tools we\\u2019re adding](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/), and, most recently, [how you all have shaped our designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/). Today, we\\u2019re going to try something a little different. We\\u2019d like to take all of you on a field trip, [to the Museum of Reddit](https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png)!\\n\\nWhen we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past \\\\(on Reddit [and other sites](http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png)\\\\). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.\\n\\n**Trippin\\u2019 Through Time**\\n\\nWhen Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny\\u2019s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit\\u2019s front page [looked like this](https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg\\u0026s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456).\\n\\nIn the site\\u2019s early days, [u/spez](/user/spez) and [u/kn0thing](/user/kn0thing) played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests [by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks](http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html), and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned\\\\-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/).\\n\\nAs Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. \\\\(Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...\\\\)\\n\\nThey launched commenting. \\\\(The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).\\\\) They recoded the entire site [from Lisp to Python](https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg\\u0026s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217). They added [limits on the lengths of post titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/z9yk/reddit_headlines_have_been_getting_longer_and/). And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit\\u2019s biggest change to date: [user\\\\-created subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/).\\n\\nIt\\u2019s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it [wasn\\u2019t without controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/). In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and [argued](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/) [passionately](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/) [against](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/) [subreddits](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/). \\\\(Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched [our first desktop redesign](https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/), which received its share of [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/), [bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/), and [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/) reviews.\\\\)\\n\\nDuring those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in\\\\-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user\\\\-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a [cumbersome URL trick](https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/) people used to make multireddits into [a supported feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/).\\n\\nThat approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we\\u2019ve built in the years since then, like [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) \\\\(my first project as an admin\\\\), [video hosting](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/), [mobile apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/), [mobile mod tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/), [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/), [live threads](https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/), [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/), and [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/), to name a few.\\n\\n**What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!**\\n\\nThroughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:\\n\\n* You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.\\n* The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.\\n\\nWith the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third\\\\-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like [set post requirements](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif) and [take bulk actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif) more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback \\\\(more on that in our next blog post about engineering!\\\\).\\n\\n**Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts**\\n\\nOne feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!\\n\\nLike anything we\\u2019ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we\\u2019re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.\\n\\nIn the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. \\\\(Thank you to everyone who\\u2019s given feedback so far!\\\\) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think.

Thanks to all who participated!\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nYou may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently\\u2014these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.\\n\\nAs of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.\\n\\n# What Are Community Awards?\\n\\nCommunity Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.\\n\\nCommunity Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).\\n\\n[A highly decorated post on r\\\\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f)\\n\\nIn the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.\\n\\n# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?\\n\\nCommunity Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.\\n\\nWith this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the \\u201cStar of Excellence\\u201d Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.\\n\\nMods can access the Community Bank to give\\u2026\\n\\n# Mod-Exclusive Awards\\n\\nModerators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.\\n\\nMod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don\\u2019t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.\\n\\n* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium\\n* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium\\n* \\u2026 and so on!\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:\\n\\n\\u0026#x200B;\\n\\n[This example shows the coveted Golden Toaster Award, which you can view in a larger size by hovering over the icon.](https://preview.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png?width=300\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=56520aaebbfdee38fd9cb0f80bc6339924222e40)\\n\\n# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?\\n\\nCommunity Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.\\n\\n# Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?\\n\\nCheck out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!\\n\\nWe are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:\\n\\n* They must comply with [Reddit\\u2019s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);\\n* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and\\n* They must be SFW.\\n\\n# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!\\n\\nWe've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we\\u2019re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!\\n\\nParticipating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_vlvx0rz\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 2, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Introducing Community Awards!\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": 78, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"media_metadata\": {\"rek8d44u6bc31\": {\"status\": \"valid\", \"e\": \"Image\", \"m\": \"image/png\", \"p\": [{\"y\": 111, \"x\": 108, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png?width=108\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=ffd68530dd271a0aac37852ee9386bc2b480974e\"}, {\"y\": 222, \"x\": 216, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png?width=216\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=dcd2ec80e7f6620878287d8cf1b17a3afb0bfb78\"}], \"s\": {\"y\": 309, \"x\": 300, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png?width=300\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=56520aaebbfdee38fd9cb0f80bc6339924222e40\"}, \"id\": \"rek8d44u6bc31\"}, \"fsqt84ep6bc31\": {\"status\": \"valid\", \"e\": \"Image\", \"m\": \"image/png\", \"p\": [{\"y\": 64, \"x\": 108, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=108\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=b4964a937e2f8fbc292f48ff7f8e7c08db540883\"}, {\"y\": 128, \"x\": 216, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=216\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=c0f16de401a1be1327148ee959e6a558e99f322e\"}, {\"y\": 190, \"x\": 320, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=320\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=12ce6f923e9dea9046521c7e2a80045b1c30deb0\"}, {\"y\": 381, \"x\": 640, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=640\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=20041342786f1f5f98187832bb2d2c4465aede33\"}, {\"y\": 572, \"x\": 960, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=960\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=f261d868ede280a2e1f2bc7295461c84420069ef\"}, {\"y\": 644, \"x\": 1080, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1080\\u0026crop=smart\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=65c4744762c7ab57257927ced26f56b8bed567db\"}], \"s\": {\"y\": 1150, \"x\": 1928, \"u\": \"https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f\"}, \"id\": \"fsqt84ep6bc31\"}}, \"name\": \"t3_chdx1h\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.71, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 13875, \"total_awards_received\": 18, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": 140, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 13875, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-D0hxchgus9EyzvGqvnabK_3Obl93tMfG9G58V1QwW8.jpg\", \"edited\": 1567640499.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 4, \"gid_2\": 2}, \"post_hint\": \"self\", \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1564030758.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EUPDATE (9/4):\\u003C/strong\\u003E Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share\\u0026amp;utm_medium=web2x\\\"\\u003Eannounced below in the stickied comment\\u003C/a\\u003E!

found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we\\u2019ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). \\n\\nWe hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.\\n\\nOur goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn\\u2019t easy as a small company as we don\\u2019t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.\\n\\nIn 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.\\n\\nIn 2016, we\\u2019ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.\\n\\nIn addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. \\n\\nWe are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines).

But with the upcoming election, we know you want to see more. So we're committing to a quarterly report on content manipulation and account security, with the first to be shared in October. But first, we want to share context today on the history of content manipulation efforts and how we've evolved over the years to keep the site authentic.\\n\\n**A brief history** \\n\\nThe concern of content manipulation on Reddit is as old as Reddit itself. Before there were subreddits (circa 2005), everyone saw the same content and we were primarily concerned with spam and vote manipulation. As we grew in scale and introduced subreddits, we had to become more sophisticated in our detection and mitigation of these issues. The creation of subreddits also created new threats, with \\u201cbrigading\\u201d becoming a more common occurrence (even if rarely defined). Today, we are not only dealing with growth hackers, bots, and your typical shitheadery, but we have to worry about more advanced threats, such as state actors interested in interfering with elections and inflaming social divisions. This represents an evolution in content manipulation, not only on Reddit, but across the internet. These advanced adversaries have resources far larger than a typical spammer. However, as with early days at Reddit, we are committed to combating this threat, while better empowering users and moderators to minimize exposure to inauthentic or manipulated content.\\n\\n**What we\\u2019ve done** \\n\\nOur strategy has been to focus on fundamentals and double down on things that have protected our platform in the past (including the [2016 election](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/)). Influence campaigns represent an evolution in content manipulation, not something fundamentally new. This means that these campaigns are built on top of some of the same tactics as historical manipulators (certainly with their own flavor). Namely, compromised accounts, vote manipulation, and inauthentic community engagement. This is why we have hardened our protections against these types of issues on the site. \\n\\n*Compromised accounts* \\n\\nThis year alone, we have taken preventative actions on over 10.6M accounts with compromised login credentials ([check yo\\u2019 self](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)), or accounts that have been hit by bots attempting to breach them. This is important because compromised accounts can be used to gain immediate credibility on the site, and to quickly scale up a content attack on the site (yes, even that throwaway account with password = Password! is a potential threat!).\\n\\n*Vote Manipulation*\\n\\nThe purpose of our anti-cheating rules is to make it difficult for a person to unduly impact the votes on a particular piece of content. These rules, along with user downvotes (because you know bad content when you see it), are some of the most powerful protections we have to ensure that misinformation and low quality content doesn\\u2019t get much traction on Reddit. We have strengthened these protections (in ways we can\\u2019t fully share without giving away the secret sauce). As a result, we have reduced the visibility of vote manipulated content by 20% over the last 12 months.\\n\\n*Content Manipulation*\\n\\nContent manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, etc. We have completely overhauled how we handle these issues, including a stronger focus on proactive detection, and machine learning to help surface clusters of bad accounts. With our newer methods, we can make improvements in detection more quickly and ensure that we are more complete in taking down all accounts that are connected to any attempt. We removed over 900% more policy violating content in the first half of 2019 than the same period in 2018, and 99% of that was before it was reported by users. \\n\\n*User Empowerment* \\n\\nOutside of admin-level detection and mitigation, we recognize that a large part of what has kept the content on Reddit authentic is the users and moderators. In our [2017 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) we highlighted the relatively small impact that Russian trolls had on the site. 71% of the trolls had 0 karma or less! This is a direct consequence of you all, and we want to continue to empower you to play a strong role in the Reddit ecosystem. We are investing in a safety product team that will build improved safety (user and content) features on the site. We are still staffing this up, but we hope to deliver new features soon (including Crowd Control, which we are in the process of refining thanks to the good feedback from our alpha testers). These features will start to provide users and moderators better information and control over the type of content that is seen. \\n\\n**What\\u2019s next** \\n\\nThe next component of this battle is the collaborative aspect. As a consequence of the large resources available to state-backed adversaries and their nefarious goals, it is important to recognize that this fight is not one that Reddit faces alone. In combating these advanced adversaries, we will collaborate with other players in this space, including law enforcement, and other platforms. By working with these groups, we can better investigate threats as they occur  on Reddit. \\n\\n**Our commitment** \\n\\nThese adversaries are more advanced than previous ones, but we are committed to ensuring that Reddit content is free from manipulation. At times, some of our efforts may seem heavy handed (forcing password resets), and other times they may be more opaque, but know that behind the scenes we are working hard on these problems. In order to provide additional transparency around our actions, we will publish a narrow scope security-report each quarter. This will focus on actions surrounding content manipulation and account security (note, it will not include any of the information on legal requests and day-to-day content policy removals, as these will continue to be released annually in our[ Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018)). We will get our first one out in October. If there is specific information you\\u2019d like or questions you have, let us know in the comments below.\\n\\n[EDIT: Im signing off, thank you all for the great questions and feedback.

However, as with early days at Reddit, we are committed to combating this threat, while better empowering users and moderators to minimize exposure to inauthentic or manipulated content.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat we\\u2019ve done\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOur strategy has been to focus on fundamentals and double down on things that have protected our platform in the past (including the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/\\\"\\u003E2016 election\\u003C/a\\u003E). Influence campaigns represent an evolution in content manipulation, not something fundamentally new. This means that these campaigns are built on top of some of the same tactics as historical manipulators (certainly with their own flavor). Namely, compromised accounts, vote manipulation, and inauthentic community engagement. This is why we have hardened our protections against these types of issues on the site. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ECompromised accounts\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis year alone, we have taken preventative actions on over 10.6M accounts with compromised login credentials (\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\\\"\\u003Echeck yo\\u2019 self\\u003C/a\\u003E), or accounts that have been hit by bots attempting to breach them. This is important because compromised accounts can be used to gain immediate credibility on the site, and to quickly scale up a content attack on the site (yes, even that throwaway account with password = Password! is a potential threat!).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EVote Manipulation\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe purpose of our anti-cheating rules is to make it difficult for a person to unduly impact the votes on a particular piece of content. These rules, along with user downvotes (because you know bad content when you see it), are some of the most powerful protections we have to ensure that misinformation and low quality content doesn\\u2019t get much traction on Reddit. We have strengthened these protections (in ways we can\\u2019t fully share without giving away the secret sauce). As a result, we have reduced the visibility of vote manipulated content by 20% over the last 12 months.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EContent Manipulation\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EContent manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, etc. We have completely overhauled how we handle these issues, including a stronger focus on proactive detection, and machine learning to help surface clusters of bad accounts. With our newer methods, we can make improvements in detection more quickly and ensure that we are more complete in taking down all accounts that are connected to any attempt. We removed over 900% more policy violating content in the first half of 2019 than the same period in 2018, and 99% of that was before it was reported by users. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EUser Empowerment\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOutside of admin-level detection and mitigation, we recognize that a large part of what has kept the content on Reddit authentic is the users and moderators. In our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/\\\"\\u003E2017 transparency report\\u003C/a\\u003E we highlighted the relatively small impact that Russian trolls had on the site. 71% of the trolls had 0 karma or less! This is a direct consequence of you all, and we want to continue to empower you to play a strong role in the Reddit ecosystem. We are investing in a safety product team that will build improved safety (user and content) features on the site. We are still staffing this up, but we hope to deliver new features soon (including Crowd Control, which we are in the process of refining thanks to the good feedback from our alpha testers). These features will start to provide users and moderators better information and control over the type of content that is seen. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat\\u2019s next\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe next component of this battle is the collaborative aspect. As a consequence of the large resources available to state-backed adversaries and their nefarious goals, it is important to recognize that this fight is not one that Reddit faces alone. In combating these advanced adversaries, we will collaborate with other players in this space, including law enforcement, and other platforms. By working with these groups, we can better investigate threats as they occur  on Reddit. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOur commitment\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese adversaries are more advanced than previous ones, but we are committed to ensuring that Reddit content is free from manipulation. At times, some of our efforts may seem heavy handed (forcing password resets), and other times they may be more opaque, but know that behind the scenes we are working hard on these problems. In order to provide additional transparency around our actions, we will publish a narrow scope security-report each quarter. This will focus on actions surrounding content manipulation and account security (note, it will not include any of the information on legal requests and day-to-day content policy removals, as these will continue to be released annually in our\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018\\\"\\u003E Transparency Report\\u003C/a\\u003E). We will get our first one out in October.

safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/). Today we are sharing our first Reddit Security Report, which we'll be continuing on a quarterly basis. We are committed to continuously evolving how we tackle these problems. The purpose of these reports is to keep you informed about relevant events and actions.\\n\\n### **By The Numbers**\\n\\n|**Category**|**Volume (July - Sept)**|**Volume (April - June)**| \\n|---|---|---|\\n|Content manipulation reports|5,461,005|5,222,058|\\n|Admin content manipulation removals|19,149,133|14,375,903|\\n|Admin content manipulation account sanctions|1,406,440|2,520,474|\\n|3rd party breach accounts processed|4,681,297,045|1,355,654,815|\\n|Protective account security actions|7,190,318|1,845,605|\\n\\n\\nThese are the primary metrics we track internally, and we thought you\\u2019d want to see them too. If there are alternative metrics that seem worth looking at as part of this report, we\\u2019re all ears.\\n\\n#### **Content Manipulation**\\n\\nContent manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, vote manipulation, etc. This year we have overhauled how we handle these issues, and this quarter was no different. We focused these efforts on:\\n\\n1. Improving our detection models for accounts performing these actions \\n2. Making it harder for them to spin up new accounts \\n\\nRecently, we also improved our enforcement measures against accounts taking part in [vote manipulation](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or) (i.e. when people coordinate or otherwise cheat to increase or decrease the vote scores on Reddit). Over the last 6 months (and mostly during the last couple of months), we increased our actions against accounts participating in vote manipulation by about 30x. We sanctioned or warned around 22k accounts for this in the last 3 weeks of September alone.\\n\\n#### **Account Security**\\n\\nThis quarter, we finished up a major effort to detect all accounts that had credentials matching historical 3rd party breaches. It's important to track breaches that happen on other sites or services because bad actors will use those same username/password combinations to break into your other accounts (on the basis that a percentage of people reuse passwords). You might have experienced some of our efforts if we forced you to reset your password as a precaution. We expect the number of protective account security actions to drop drastically going forward as we no longer have a large backlog of breach datasets to process. Hopefully we have reached a steady state, which should reduce some of the pain for users. We will continue to deal with new breach sets that come in, as well as accounts that are hit by bots attempting to gain access (please take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) on how you can improve your account security). \\n\\n#### **Our Recent Investigations**  \\n\\nWe have a lot of investigations active at any given time (courtesy of your neighborhood t-shirt spammers and VPN peddlers), and while we can\\u2019t cover them all, we want to use this report to share the results of just some of that work.  \\n\\n**Ban Evasion**\\n\\nThis quarter, we dealt with a highly coordinated ban evasion ring from users of r/opieandanthony. This began after we banned the subreddit for targeted harassment of users, as well as repeated copyright infringement. The group would quickly pop up on both new and abandoned subreddits to continue the abuse. We also learned that they were coordinating on another platform and through dedicated websites to redirect users to the latest target of their harassment. \\n\\nThis situation was different from your run-of-the-mill ~~shitheadery~~ ban evasion because the group was both creating new subreddits *and* resurrecting inactive or unmoderated subreddits. We quickly adjusted our efforts to this behavior. We also reported their offending account to the other platform and they were quick to ban the account. We then contacted the hosts of the independent websites to report the abuse. This helped ensure that the sites are no longer able to redirect automatically to Reddit for abuse purposes. Ultimately, we banned 78 subreddits (5 of which existed prior to the attack), and suspended 2,382 accounts. The ban evading activity has largely ceased (you know...until they read this).\\n\\nThere are a few takeaways from this investigation worth pulling out: \\n\\n1. Ban evaders (and others up to no good) often work across platforms, and so it\\u2019s important for those of us in the industry to also share information when we spot these types of coordinated campaigns.\\n2. The layered moderation on Reddit works: Moderators brought this to our attention and did some awesome initial investigating; our Community team was then able to communicate with mods and users to help surface suspicious behavior; our detection teams were able to quickly detect and stop the efforts of the ban evaders. \\n3. We have also been developing and testing new tools to address ban evasion recently. This was a good opportunity to test them in the wild, and they were incredibly effective at detecting and quickly actioning many of the accounts that were responsible for the ban evasion actions. We want to roll these tools out more broadly (expect a future post around this). \\n\\n**Reports of Suspected Manipulation**\\n\\nThe protests in Hong Kong have been a growing concern worldwide, and as always, conversation on Reddit reflects this. It\\u2019s no surprise that we\\u2019ve seen Hong Kong-related communities grow immensely in recent months as a result. With this growth, we have received a number of user reports and comments asking if there is manipulation in these communities. We take the authenticity of conversation on Reddit incredibly seriously, and we want to address your concerns here. \\n\\nFirst, we have not detected widespread manipulation in Hong Kong related subreddits nor seen any manipulation that affected those communities or their conversations in a meaningful way.\\n\\nIt's worth taking a step back to talk about what we look for in these situations. While we obviously can\\u2019t share all of our tactics for investigating these threats, there are some signals that users will be familiar with. When trying to understand if a community is facing widespread manipulation, we will look at foundational signals such as the presence of vote manipulation, mod ban rates (because mods know their community better than we do), spam content removals, and other signals that allow us to detect coordinated and scaled activities (*pause for dramatic effect*). If this doesn\\u2019t sound like the stuff of spy novels, it\\u2019s because it\\u2019s not. We continually talk about foundational safety metrics like vote manipulation, and spam removals because these are the same tools that advanced adversaries use (For more thoughts on this look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/d6l41l/an_update_on_content_manipulation_and_an_upcoming/)). \\n\\nSecond, let\\u2019s look at what other major platforms have reported on coordinated behavior targeting Hong Kong. Their investigations revealed attempts consisting primarily of very low quality propaganda. This is important when looking for similar efforts on Reddit. In healthier communities like r/hongkong, we simply don\\u2019t see a proliferation of this low-quality content (from users or adversaries). The story does change when looking at r/sino or r/Hong_Kong (note the mod overlap). In these subreddits, we see far more low quality and one-sided content. However, this is not against our rules, and indeed it is not even particularly unusual to see one-sided viewpoints in some geographically specific subreddits...What IS against the rules is coordinated action (state sponsored or otherwise). We have looked closely at these subreddits and we have found no indicators of widespread coordination. In other words, we do see this low quality content in these subreddits, but it seems to be happening in a genuine way. \\n\\nIf you see anything suspicious, please report it to us [here](https://www.reddit.com/report). If it\\u2019s regarding potential coordinated efforts that aren't as well-suited to our regular report system, you can also use our separate investigations report flow by [emailing us](mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com). \\n\\n#### **Final Thoughts**\\n\\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge the reports our peers have published during the past couple of months (or even today). Whenever these reports come out, we always do our own investigation. We have not found any similar attempts on our own platform this quarter. Part of this is a recognition that Reddit today is less international than these other platforms, with the majority of users being in the US, and other English speaking countries. Additionally, our layered moderation structure (user up/down-votes, community moderation, admin policy enforcement) makes Reddit a more challenging platform to manipulate in a scaled way (i.e. Reddit is hard). Finally, Reddit is simply not well suited to being an amplification platform, nor do we aim to be. This reach is ultimately what an adversary is looking for. We continue to monitor these efforts, and are committed to being transparent about anything that we do detect. \\n\\nAs I mentioned above, this is the first version of these reports.

Over the last 6 months (and mostly during the last couple of months), we increased our actions against accounts participating in vote manipulation by about 30x. We sanctioned or warned around 22k accounts for this in the last 3 weeks of September alone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAccount Security\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis quarter, we finished up a major effort to detect all accounts that had credentials matching historical 3rd party breaches. It\\u0026#39;s important to track breaches that happen on other sites or services because bad actors will use those same username/password combinations to break into your other accounts (on the basis that a percentage of people reuse passwords). You might have experienced some of our efforts if we forced you to reset your password as a precaution. We expect the number of protective account security actions to drop drastically going forward as we no longer have a large backlog of breach datasets to process. Hopefully we have reached a steady state, which should reduce some of the pain for users. We will continue to deal with new breach sets that come in, as well as accounts that are hit by bots attempting to gain access (please take a look at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/\\\"\\u003Ethis post\\u003C/a\\u003E on how you can improve your account security). \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOur Recent Investigations\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe have a lot of investigations active at any given time (courtesy of your neighborhood t-shirt spammers and VPN peddlers), and while we can\\u2019t cover them all, we want to use this report to share the results of just some of that work.  \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBan Evasion\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis quarter, we dealt with a highly coordinated ban evasion ring from users of \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/opieandanthony\\\"\\u003Er/opieandanthony\\u003C/a\\u003E. This began after we banned the subreddit for targeted harassment of users, as well as repeated copyright infringement. The group would quickly pop up on both new and abandoned subreddits to continue the abuse. We also learned that they were coordinating on another platform and through dedicated websites to redirect users to the latest target of their harassment. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis situation was different from your run-of-the-mill \\u003Cdel\\u003Eshitheadery\\u003C/del\\u003E ban evasion because the group was both creating new subreddits \\u003Cem\\u003Eand\\u003C/em\\u003E resurrecting inactive or unmoderated subreddits. We quickly adjusted our efforts to this behavior. We also reported their offending account to the other platform and they were quick to ban the account. We then contacted the hosts of the independent websites to report the abuse. This helped ensure that the sites are no longer able to redirect automatically to Reddit for abuse purposes. Ultimately, we banned 78 subreddits (5 of which existed prior to the attack), and suspended 2,382 accounts. The ban evading activity has largely ceased (you know...until they read this).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere are a few takeaways from this investigation worth pulling out: \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Col\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EBan evaders (and others up to no good) often work across platforms, and so it\\u2019s important for those of us in the industry to also share information when we spot these types of coordinated campaigns.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EThe layered moderation on Reddit works: Moderators brought this to our attention and did some awesome initial investigating; our Community team was then able to communicate with mods and users to help surface suspicious behavior; our detection teams were able to quickly detect and stop the efforts of the ban evaders. \\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EWe have also been developing and testing new tools to address ban evasion recently. This was a good opportunity to test them in the wild, and they were incredibly effective at detecting and quickly actioning many of the accounts that were responsible for the ban evasion actions. We want to roll these tools out more broadly (expect a future post around this). \\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ol\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EReports of Suspected Manipulation\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe protests in Hong Kong have been a growing concern worldwide, and as always, conversation on Reddit reflects this. It\\u2019s no surprise that we\\u2019ve seen Hong Kong-related communities grow immensely in recent months as a result. With this growth, we have received a number of user reports and comments asking if there is manipulation in these communities. We take the authenticity of conversation on Reddit incredibly seriously, and we want to address your concerns here. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst, we have not detected widespread manipulation in Hong Kong related subreddits nor seen any manipulation that affected those communities or their conversations in a meaningful way.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#39;s worth taking a step back to talk about what we look for in these situations. While we obviously can\\u2019t share all of our tactics for investigating these threats, there are some signals that users will be familiar with. When trying to understand if a community is facing widespread manipulation, we will look at foundational signals such as the presence of vote manipulation, mod ban rates (because mods know their community better than we do), spam content removals, and other signals that allow us to detect coordinated and scaled activities (\\u003Cem\\u003Epause for dramatic effect\\u003C/em\\u003E). If this doesn\\u2019t sound like the stuff of spy novels, it\\u2019s because it\\u2019s not. We continually talk about foundational safety metrics like vote manipulation, and spam removals because these are the same tools that advanced adversaries use (For more thoughts on this look \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/d6l41l/an_update_on_content_manipulation_and_an_upcoming/\\\"\\u003Ehere\\u003C/a\\u003E). \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESecond, let\\u2019s look at what other major platforms have reported on coordinated behavior targeting Hong Kong. Their investigations revealed attempts consisting primarily of very low quality propaganda. This is important when looking for similar efforts on Reddit. In healthier communities like \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/hongkong\\\"\\u003Er/hongkong\\u003C/a\\u003E, we simply don\\u2019t see a proliferation of this low-quality content (from users or adversaries). The story does change when looking at \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/sino\\\"\\u003Er/sino\\u003C/a\\u003E or \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/Hong_Kong\\\"\\u003Er/Hong_Kong\\u003C/a\\u003E (note the mod overlap). In these subreddits, we see far more low quality and one-sided content. However, this is not against our rules, and indeed it is not even particularly unusual to see one-sided viewpoints in some geographically specific subreddits...What IS against the rules is coordinated action (state sponsored or otherwise). We have looked closely at these subreddits and we have found no indicators of widespread coordination. In other words, we do see this low quality content in these subreddits, but it seems to be happening in a genuine way. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf you see anything suspicious, please report it to us \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/report\\\"\\u003Ehere\\u003C/a\\u003E. If it\\u2019s regarding potential coordinated efforts that aren\\u0026#39;t as well-suited to our regular report system, you can also use our separate investigations report flow by [emailing us](mailto:\\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com\\\"\\u003Einvestigations@reddit.zendesk.com\\u003C/a\\u003E). \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFinal Thoughts\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFinally, I would like to acknowledge the reports our peers have published during the past couple of months (or even today). Whenever these reports come out, we always do our own investigation. We have not found any similar attempts on our own platform this quarter. Part of this is a recognition that Reddit today is less international than these other platforms, with the majority of users being in the US, and other English speaking countries. Additionally, our layered moderation structure (user up/down-votes, community moderation, admin policy enforcement) makes Reddit a more challenging platform to manipulate in a scaled way (i.e. Reddit is hard). Finally, Reddit is simply not well suited to being an amplification platform, nor do we aim to be. This reach is ultimately what an adversary is looking for. We continue to monitor these efforts, and are committed to being transparent about anything that we do detect. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs I mentioned above, this is the first version of these reports.

We monitor trends and compare against known threats. \\n* **Check passwords against 3rd party breach datasets** \\\\- We check for username / password combinations in 3rd party breach sets. \\n* **Display your recent IP sessions for you to access** \\\\- You can check your [account activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) at any time to see your recent login IPs. Keep in mind that the geolocation of each login may not be exact and will only include events within the last 100 days. If you see something you don\\u2019t recognize, you should change your password immediately and ensure your email address is correct.\\n\\nIf we determine that your account is vulnerable to compromise (or has actually been compromised), we lock the account and force a password reset. If we can\\u2019t establish account ownership or the account has been used in a malicious manner that prevents it being returned to the original owner, the account may be permanently suspended and closed.\\n\\n**What you can do** to prevent this situation:\\n\\n* **Use permanent emails** \\\\- We highly encourage users to link their accounts to accessible email addresses that you regularly check (you can add and update email addresses in your [user settings page](https://new.reddit.com/settings) if you are using new reddit, otherwise you can do that from the [preferences page](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/update) in old reddit). This is also how you will receive any activities alerting you of suspicious activity on your account if you\\u2019re signed out. As a general rule of thumb, avoid using email addresses you don't have permanent ownership over like school or work addresses. Temporary email addresses that expire are a bad idea.\\n* **Verify your emails** \\\\- Verifying your email helps us confirm that there is a real person creating the account and that you have access to the email address given. If we determine that your account has been compromised, this is the only way we have to validate account ownership. Without this our only option will be to permanently close the account to prevent further misuse and access to the original owner\\u2019s data. There will be no appeals possible!\\n* **Check your profile occasionally to make sure your email address is current.** You can do this via the [preferences page on old reddit](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/) or the [settings page in new reddit](https://new.reddit.com/settings). It\\u2019s easy to forget to update it when you change schools, service providers, or set up new accounts. \\n* **Use strong/unique passwords** \\\\- Use passwords that are complex and not used on any other site. We recommend using a password manager to help you generate and securely store passwords. \\n* [**Add two factor authentication**](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) \\\\- For an extra layer of security. If someone gets ahold of your username/password combo, they will not be able to log into your account without entering the verification code.\\n\\nWe know users want to protect their privacy and don\\u2019t always want to provide an email address to companies, so we don\\u2019t require it. However, there are certain account protections that require users establish ownership, which is why an email address is required for password reset requests. Forcing password resets on vulnerable accounts is one of many ways we try to secure potentially compromised accounts and prevent manipulation of our platform. Accounts flagged as compromised with a verified email receive a forced password reset notice, but accounts without one will be permanently closed. In the past, manual attempts to establish ownership on accounts with lost access rarely resulted in an account recovery. Because manual attempts are ineffective and time consuming for our operations teams and you, we won\\u2019t be doing them moving forward. You're welcome to use Reddit without an email address associated with your account, but do so with the understanding of the account protection limitation.

everything in order but, since my resignation as head of community made its way to the media, I'd like to discuss why I'm leaving and what's next for you!\\nI want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community. A large part of my role as Head of Community was reflected behind the scenes (policy, community regulation etc.) and the community team is much more interactive than I on a daily basis so very little will change after my departure.\\n\\nMedia outlets are suggesting that the circumstances around my departure are different than they are in reality so I'd like to clear this up as I don't like being misrepresented. Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause. That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them.\\n\\nAt the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family. The last few years have been pretty crazy and honestly, I'm looking forward to a Christmas free of work - but still encourage you all to continue to make the [reddit gift exchange](https://www.redditgifts.com/) a ground breaking experience!!! It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now. \\n\\nSo what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.\\n\\nLucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When /u/spez asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of, /u/krispykrackers.

Also, a fun contest! Let\\u2019s get to it...\\n\\n## What\\u2019s New\\n\\n*New Name: Multireddits \\u2192 Custom Feeds*\\n\\nMultireddits have been around a [long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/). They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven\\u2019t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to \\u201cCustom Feeds.\\u201d Sometimes simple is better.\\n\\n*More Support*\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We\\u2019ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.\\n\\n[iOS Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png?width=3360\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=c92d7268dbcd46b35d6d2380b8316d4471dc1aac)\\n\\n*New Follow Functionality*\\n\\nYou can now follow another redditor\\u2019s Custom Feed (as long as it\\u2019s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you\\u2019ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.\\n\\n[Follow on new Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png?width=3360\\u0026format=png\\u0026auto=webp\\u0026s=4576c32bf987c0dadf6a41024134387f96b45fb4)\\n\\n*Improved Sharing*\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it\\u2019s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won\\u2019t work for anyone else.  We\\u2019ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.\\n\\n*Spaces*\\n\\nYou can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed. [Enough said.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif)\\n\\n*Mix and Match*\\n\\nFollow a mix of communities and profiles.\\n\\n*Coming Soon*\\n\\nIn the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.\\n\\n## The Contest\\n\\nWe are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the [gold](https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif) part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.\\n\\nTo submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. **It must be public.** Please only submit one feed per category.\\n\\nHere are the categories that we will award winners from:\\n\\n* Aww\\n* Artist Resources\\n* Beauty\\n* Books \\u0026 Writing\\n* Cool Pictures (images only)\\n* Discussion (text only)\\n* Fashion\\n* Food \\u0026 Cooking\\n* Health \\u0026 Fitness\\n* Music\\n* Parenting\\n* Quirky\\n* Sports\\n* Travel\\n* Wholesome\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.\\n\\nHere are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):\\n\\n* [Some of my favorite

They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven\\u2019t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to \\u201cCustom Feeds.\\u201d Sometimes simple is better.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EMore Support\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe\\u2019ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors\\u0026#39; feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit.

This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you\\u2019ll see that update the next time you open the feed.

blog series](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.\\n\\nFun fact: When Reddit first launched, user\\\\-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.\\n\\n# Features inspired by the community\\n\\n[**Image Flair - Emojis**](https://i.redditmedia.com/Tk7MR1_C8WtRpgrtnQfM4qziSIsS7q5S1lirkhcMlZo.png?s=048534b6d6837c5a0d2c708b34d2fe3f)\\n\\nGiving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like [r/baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball)'s team logo flair and [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW)'s faction icons. To make this process simpler, we\\u2019re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.\\n\\n[**Submit Validation**](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif)\\n\\nModerators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren\\u2019t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.\\n\\n[**Flair Filtering**](https://i.redditmedia.com/ERuv8BBJBhRL28_cexQVDulJ2q2djLR9tiSCoLmC7iw.png?s=22b5edba1b74e4e1ef604057907f7509)\\n\\nMany subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities. [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting, [r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop) uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we\\u2019ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.\\n\\n**Sidebar**\\n\\nMany mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of [r/WholesomeMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeMemes) to [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA)'s schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes [text widgets](https://i.redd.it/7u6ttrufr6g01.png), [button widgets](https://i.redd.it/117hrvjx6af01.png), [image widgets](https://i.redd.it/uhg3r378s6g01.png), [a calendar widget](https://i.redd.it/t2l2jrhy6af01.png), [a related communities widget](https://i.redd.it/8kfygo3y6af01.png), and [a rules widget](https://i.redd.it/grx7kklsr6g01.png). But we\\u2019re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.\\n\\n# Features inspired by 3rd-party tools\\n\\nCommunities themselves aren\\u2019t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd\\\\-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite \\\\(RES\\\\).\\n\\n**Toolbox:** [**Bulk Mod Actions**](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif)\\n\\nModerating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third\\\\-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You\\u2019ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.\\n\\n**RES:** [**Show All Images \\\\(aka Card View\\\\)**](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif)\\n\\nRES has enhanced Reddit\\u2019s expandos \\\\(i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs\\\\) for years, and one of the most popular features has been \\u201cshow all images\\u201d \\\\(i.e., expand all the things!\\\\). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post\\u2019s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.\\n\\n**RES:** [**User Info Cards** **\\\\(inline banning/muting\\\\)**](https://i.redd.it/q070hj0yv6g01.gif)\\n\\nWhen cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they\\u2019ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user\\u2019s stats \\\\(like account age and karma score\\\\) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio\\u2014plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.\\n\\n**Toolbox:** [**Removal Reasons**](https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif)\\n\\nOver the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox\\\\-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we\\u2019re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. \\\\(Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.\\\\)\\n\\n**Styling**\\n\\nToday it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. [Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn\\u2019t work on mobile.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif) With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. \\\\(But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.\\\\)\\n\\nWith these new features, we're excited to say that [styling a community is much easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/). Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like [r/AskReddit](https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png), [r/CasualConversation](https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png), [r/Greenday](https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png), [r/ITookAPicture](https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png), and [r/NASCAR](https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png). We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.\\n\\n**Join the Redesign!**\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, we\\u2019ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews).\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_ubcaq\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 0, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Because it\\u2019s Valentine\\u2019s Day\\u2026 here\\u2019s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": null, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_7xjt6g\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.71, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 8438, \"total_awards_received\": 1, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": null, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 8438, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"self\", \"edited\": false, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 1}, \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1518659209.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EHi All,\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETwo weeks ago, we \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/\\\"\\u003Ekicked off our blog series\\u003C/a\\u003E to take you behind the scenes of the redesign.

In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future.

redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts, [u/Amg137](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amg137) and [u/hueylewisandthesnoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/hueylewisandthesnoos) talked about[ why we're redesigning](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign),[ moderation in the redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded),[ our approach to design](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team), and[ Reddit\\u2019s evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit). Today, Reddit\\u2019s Engineering team invites you \\u201cunder the hood\\u201d look at how we\\u2019re giving a long overdue update to Reddit\\u2019s core stack.\\n\\nSpoiler: There\\u2019s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we\\u2019ll get through it together.\\n\\n**History and Journey**\\n\\nFor most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit\\u2019s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days\\u2014a [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \\\\(aka \\u201cr2\\u201d\\\\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.\\n\\nGiven Reddit\\u2019s historically tiny eng team \\\\(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\\\\), our code wasn\\u2019t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:\\n\\n* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): \\\"For a while now, \\u2018The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist\\u2019 has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.\\u201d\\n* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): \\\"After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \\\\(unsurprisingly\\\\) part of the code review process is to use \\u2018git blame\\u2019 to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \\\\(one of the more core JS files we had\\\\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being \\u2018full stack\\u2019 to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \\\\(and depressed\\\\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \\\\(a senior web dev\\\\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.\\\"\\n* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): \\u201cI worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.\\u201d\\n\\nLuckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team\\u2019s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you\\u2019ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \\\\(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\\\\), and new features \\\\(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\\\\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.\\n\\nEnter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit\\u2019s desktop code to date.\\n\\n**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**\\n\\nTwo years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \\\\(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\\\\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn\\u2019t want to outright break.\\n\\nWhen we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble\\u2014with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit\\u2019s 330 million monthly users.\\n\\nBut above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase \\\"developer velocity,\\\" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more \\\"git blame\\\" for decade\\\\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.\\n\\n**The New Tech Stack**\\n\\nThese are the three main components we use in the redesign today:\\n\\n* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\\\\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.\\n* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.\\n* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\\\\-related bugs, has good built\\\\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \\\\(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\\\\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)\\n\\n**Just the Beginning**\\n\\nWith our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We\\u2019ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we\\u2019ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \\\\(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\\\\).

Over its first five years, Reddit\\u2019s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days\\u2014a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/\\\"\\u003Ecomplete rewrite\\u003C/a\\u003E from Lisp to Python in 2006, then \\u003Cem\\u003Eanother\\u003C/em\\u003E Python rewrite (aka \\u201cr2\\u201d) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spez\\\"\\u003Eu/spez\\u003C/a\\u003E wrote about ten years ago.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGiven Reddit\\u2019s historically tiny eng team (at one point it was literally just \\u003Ca href=\\\"/user/spladug\\\"\\u003Eu/spladug\\u003C/a\\u003E), our code wasn\\u2019t always ideal... But before I get into how we\\u0026#39;ve gone about fixing that, I thought it\\u0026#39;d be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug\\\"\\u003Eu/spladug\\u003C/a\\u003E: \\u0026quot;For a while now, \\u2018The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist\\u2019 has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.\\u201d\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa\\\"\\u003Eu/KeyserSosa\\u003C/a\\u003E: \\u0026quot;After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that (unsurprisingly) part of the code review process is to use \\u2018git blame\\u2019 to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file (one of the more core JS files we had). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being \\u2018full stack\\u2019 to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised (and depressed) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee (a senior web dev) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn\\u0026#39;t know what I was doing.\\u0026quot;\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis\\\"\\u003Eu/ketralnis\\u003C/a\\u003E: \\u201cI worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.\\u201d\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELuckily, Reddit\\u0026#39;s engineering team has grown \\u003Cem\\u003Ea lot\\u003C/em\\u003E since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team\\u2019s current size, we\\u0026#39;re finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you\\u2019ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements (like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons), and new features (like inline images in text posts and submit validation). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEnter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit\\u2019s desktop code to date.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDesigning Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETwo years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages (Javascript on the client and Python on the server). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn\\u2019t want to outright break.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren\\u0026#39;t just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble\\u2014with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit\\u2019s 330 million monthly users.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase \\u0026quot;developer velocity,\\u0026quot; or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more \\u0026quot;git blame\\u0026quot; for decade-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe New Tech Stack\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese are the three main components we use in the redesign today:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EReact is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components.

image, video, or gallery in a **link post** that can be expanded with a button and viewed directly on listings and comments pages without having to leave Reddit.  Right now, we have media previews for certain types of videos, image galleries and sound files.  Media previews are controlled by [buttons that look like this](http://i.imgur.com/epKvK2w.png).\\n\\n#That\\u2019s wonderful, but what have you actually changed?\\n\\n**Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages**\\n\\nBy default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.  [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png).  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.\\n\\n**New Media Preferences**\\n\\nYou can control how media previews display on your screen with [new preferences](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) available on your [preferences page](http://reddit.com/prefs).  \\n\\n**Media previews support more file types**\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.

You\\u2019ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We\\u2019re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit.

They\\u2019ll be able to post to their profile and you\\u2019ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta! \\n\\nu/hidehidehidden\\n\\n------------\\n\\n##Q\\u0026A:\\n\\n**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**\\n\\nA: This is an early release (\\u201calpha\\u201d) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**\\n\\nA: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**\\n\\nA: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we\\u2019re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**\\n\\nA: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There\\u2019s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that\\u2019s ok too.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**\\n\\nA: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**\\n\\nA: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere \\u2014 therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can\\u2019t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**\\n\\nA: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We\\u2019re also testing a new feature called \\u201cActive in these Communities\\u201d on the tester\\u2019s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**\\n\\nA: This is one reason that we\\u2019re being so careful about how we\\u2019re testing this feature \\u2014 we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what\\u2019s the difference between the two?**\\n\\nA: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: What about the existing \\u201cfriends\\u201d feature?**\\n\\nA: We\\u2019re not making any changes to the existing \\u201cfriends\\u201d feature or r/friends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**\\n\\nA: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don\\u2019t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: I\\u2019m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you\\u2019re wrong?**\\n\\nA: We don\\u2019t have all of the answers right now and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we\\u2019re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won\\u2019t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**\\n\\nA:  We\\u2019ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We\\u2019re also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). \", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_3wdtz\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 0, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"thumbnail_height\": null, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_60p3n1\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.52, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 6686, \"total_awards_received\": 1, \"media_embed\": {}, \"thumbnail_width\": null, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 6686, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"self\", \"edited\": false, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 1}, \"post_hint\": \"self\", \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1490147414.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EHi Reddit!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EReddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet.

This is a major product launch for Reddit and we\\u2019re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: What about pseudo-anonymity?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There\\u2019s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that\\u2019s ok too.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: How will brands participate in this program?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe\\u2019re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/LeagueOfLegends\\\"\\u003Er/LeagueOfLegends\\u003C/a\\u003E and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles?

The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere \\u2014 therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can\\u2019t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/beta\\\"\\u003Er/beta\\u003C/a\\u003E community as we grow and test this new product. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We\\u2019re also testing a new feature called \\u201cActive in these Communities\\u201d on the tester\\u2019s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: This is one reason that we\\u2019re being so careful about how we\\u2019re testing this feature \\u2014 we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/beta\\\"\\u003Er/beta\\u003C/a\\u003E as the product develops and we onboard more users.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what\\u2019s the difference between the two?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: What about the existing \\u201cfriends\\u201d feature?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: We\\u2019re not making any changes to the existing \\u201cfriends\\u201d feature or \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/friends\\\"\\u003Er/friends\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA: Content policy violations will likely impact a user\\u0026#39;s ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don\\u2019t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: I\\u2019m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider.

As with any test, we\\u2019re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won\\u2019t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Chr/\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: How do I participate in this beta?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA:  We\\u2019ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit.

changes to our Privacy Policy and User Agreement, and about some internal changes designed to continue protecting your privacy as we grow.\\n\\nWe regularly review our internal practices and policies to make sure that our commitment to your privacy is reflected across reddit. This year, to make sure we continue to focus on privacy as we grow as a company, we have created a cross-functional privacy group.  This group is responsible for advocating the privacy of our users as a company-wide priority and for reviewing any decision that impacts user privacy.  We created this group to ensure that, as we grow as a company, we continue to preserve privacy rights across the board and to protect your privacy.  \\n\\nOne of the first challenges for this group was how we manage and use data via our official mobile apps, since mobile platforms and advertising work differently than on the web.  Today we are publishing a new reddit [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) that reflects these changes, as well as other updates on how and when we use and protect your data.
