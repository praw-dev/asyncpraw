There are still a few things moving pretty slowly, but for the most part the site functionality should be back to normal.\\n\\nFor those curious, here are some of the nitty-gritty details on what happened:\\n\\nThis morning around 8am PST, the entire site suddenly ground to a halt. Every request was resulting in an error indicating that there was an issue with our memcached infrastructure. We performed some manual diagnostics, and couldn't actually find anything wrong.\\n\\nWith no clues on what was causing the issue, we attempted to manually restart the application layer. The restart worked for a period of time, but then quickly spiraled back down into nothing working. As we continued to dig and troubleshoot, one of our memcached instances spontaneously rebooted. Perplexed, we attempted to fail around the instance and move forward. Shortly thereafter, a second memcached instance spontaneously became unreachable.\\n\\nLast night, our hosting provider had applied some patches to our instances which were eventually going to require a reboot. They notified us about this, and we had planned a maintenance window to perform the reboots far before the time that was necessary. A postmortem followup seems to indicate that these patches were not at fault, but unfortunately at the time we had no way to quickly confirm this.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we made the decision to restart each of our memcached instances. We couldn't be certain that the instance issues were going to continue, but we felt we couldn't chance memcached instances potentially rebooting throughout the day.\\n\\nMemcached stores its entire dataset in memory, which makes it extremely fast, but also makes it completely disappear on restart. After restarting the memcached instances, our caches were completely empty. This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores, namely Postgres and Cassandra.\\n\\nSince the entire site now relied on our slower data stores, it was far from able to handle the capacity of a normal Wednesday morn. This meant we had to turn the site back on very slowly. We first threw everything into read-only mode, as it is considerably easier on the databases. We then turned things on piece by piece, in very small increments. Around 4pm, we finally had all of the pieces turned on. Some things are still moving rather slowly, but it is all there.\\n\\nWe still have a lot of investigation to do on this incident. Several unknown factors remain, such as why memcached failed in the first place, and if the instance reboot and the initial failure were in any way linked.\\n\\nIn the end, the infrastructure is the way we built it, and the responsibility to keep it running rests solely on our shoulders.

These situations include applying patches, upgrades or maintenance to the underlying hardware hosting an instance.

While you are given a Start and End time during which the reboot will take place, your instance will only be unavailable during the period that it takes to complete the reboot cycle.\\nIf you do not want to wait for a scheduled reboot, we recommend that you take the following action before the scheduled reboot time of an instance.\\nYou can perform the reboot yourself at any time.\\nAfter you do this, your instance will no longer be scheduled for reboot.\", \"edited\": false, \"downs\": 0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"is_submitter\": false, \"collapsed\": false, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"author_patreon_flair\": false, \"body_html\": \"\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EYes, I provisioned them myself.
