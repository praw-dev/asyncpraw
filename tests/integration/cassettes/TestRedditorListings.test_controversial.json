was a national tragedy. Let\\u2019s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.\\n\\nI would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.\\n\\nThe story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\\n\\nWhether you agree with r/news\\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\\n\\nWe are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We\\u2013Reddit Inc, moderators, and users\\u2013all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.\\n\\nIn the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:\\n\\n* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.\\n* [We\\u2019re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They\\u2019ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.\\n* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.\\n* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.\\n\\nAgain, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We\\u2019ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. \", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_1w72\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 2, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Let's talk about Orlando\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_4ny59k\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.52, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 7844, \"total_awards_received\": 3, \"media_embed\": {}, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 7844, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"\", \"edited\": 1465857593.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 1, \"gid_2\": 2}, \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1465884629.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EHi All,\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy.

This is a responsibility we take seriously.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe story broke on \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/news\\\"\\u003Er/news\\u003C/a\\u003E, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhether you agree with \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/news\\\"\\u003Er/news\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe are working with \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/news\\\"\\u003Er/news\\u003C/a\\u003E to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We\\u2013Reddit Inc, moderators, and users\\u2013all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003ELive threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/\\\"\\u003EWe\\u2019re introducing a change to Sticky Posts\\u003C/a\\u003E: They\\u2019ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EWe are working on a change to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/all\\\"\\u003Er/all\\u003C/a\\u003E algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EWe are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAgain, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective.

ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we\\u2019re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).\\n\\n## First, a quick recap\\n\\nSince our last post, here\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve been doing:\\n\\n* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).\\n* **We held policy calls with mods**\\u2014both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate\\u2014and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.\\n   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.\\n* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today\\u2019s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit\\u2019s community governance).\\n\\nFrom our conversations with mods and outside experts, it\\u2019s clear that while we\\u2019ve gotten better in some areas\\u2014like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)\\u2014we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.\\n\\nThese include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\u2019s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\\n\\n## New Policy\\n\\nThis is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here\\u2019s what\\u2019s different:\\n\\n* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.\\n* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\\n   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\\n* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.\\n   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.\\n* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.\\n\\nAlongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.\\n\\nAll communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we\\u2019ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users\\u2014through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.\\n\\nThough smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\\n\\nTo be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit\\u2014but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.\\n\\n## Our commitment\\n\\nOur policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.\\n\\nBut just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today\\u2019s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.\\n\\nEdit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_1w72\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 9, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"Update to Our Content Policy\", \"link_flair_richtext\": [], \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/announcements\", \"hidden\": false, \"pwls\": 6, \"link_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"hide_score\": false, \"name\": \"t3_hi3oht\", \"quarantine\": false, \"link_flair_text_color\": \"dark\", \"upvote_ratio\": 0.5, \"author_flair_background_color\": null, \"subreddit_type\": \"restricted\", \"ups\": 19645, \"total_awards_received\": 168, \"media_embed\": {}, \"author_flair_template_id\": null, \"is_original_content\": false, \"user_reports\": [], \"secure_media\": null, \"is_reddit_media_domain\": false, \"is_meta\": false, \"category\": null, \"secure_media_embed\": {}, \"link_flair_text\": null, \"can_mod_post\": false, \"score\": 19645, \"approved_by\": null, \"author_premium\": true, \"thumbnail\": \"\", \"edited\": 1593565818.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_flair_richtext\": [], \"gildings\": {\"gid_1\": 6, \"gid_2\": 9, \"gid_3\": 10}, \"content_categories\": null, \"is_self\": true, \"mod_note\": null, \"created\": 1593478806.0, \"link_flair_type\": \"text\", \"wls\": 6, \"removed_by_category\": null, \"banned_by\": null, \"author_flair_type\": \"text\", \"domain\": \"self.announcements\", \"allow_live_comments\": true, \"selftext_html\": \"\\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/\\\"\\u003EA few weeks ago\\u003C/a\\u003E, we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate.

Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit\\u2019s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.\\n\\n2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).\\n\\nReddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.\\n\\nSpam and abuse threaten Reddit\\u2019s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.\\n\\nI believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is \\\"Look Forward.\\\" Reddit has a long history, and it\\u2019s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.\\n\\nWe receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.\\n\\nThis year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.\\n\\nAs always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.\\n\\n\\u2013Steve\\n\\nedit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring.

Reddit\\u2019s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/\\\"\\u003EReddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EReddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/\\\"\\u003Enumber of improvements\\u003C/a\\u003E to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESpam and abuse threaten Reddit\\u2019s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is \\u0026quot;Look Forward.\\u0026quot; Reddit has a long history, and it\\u2019s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u2013Steve\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003Eedit: I\\u0026#39;m off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We\\u0026#39;ve got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what\\u0026#39;s in store. We\\u0026#39;ve brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring.

I ruined Thanksgiving. I\\u2019m sorry. I won\\u2019t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\\n\\nHi All,\\n\\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\\n\\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\\n\\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU\\u0026sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\\n\\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\\n\\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\\n\\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\\n\\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\\n\\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\\n\\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts.

It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMany of you are aware of my attempt to \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU\\u0026amp;sh=a9c7a036\\\"\\u003Etroll the trolls\\u003C/a\\u003E last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/\\\"\\u003Eexplained what I did\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, \\u003Ca href=\\\"/u/kn0thing\\\"\\u003Eu/kn0thing\\u003C/a\\u003E, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy\\\"\\u003EContent Policy\\u003C/a\\u003E asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EWe have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\\nPosts stickied on \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E will no longer appear in \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/all\\\"\\u003Er/all\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/all\\\"\\u003Er/all\\u003C/a\\u003E is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself.

I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\\n\\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\\n\\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \\u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\\u201d\\n\\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \\n\\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\\n\\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\\n\\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \\n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \\n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\\n\\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\\n\\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\\n\\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\\u2019s done for us over the years.\\n\\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\\n\\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\\u20132006, our idealistic \\u201cpolicy\\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \\u201cpolicy.\\u201d \\n\\nI left Reddit from 2010\\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \\n\\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \\u201cmaking Reddit worse\\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \\n\\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\\n\\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems.

I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \\u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\\u201d\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It\\u0026#39;s why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EParts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EUsers and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EOur moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\\\"\\u003Econtent policy\\u003C/a\\u003E is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (\\u003Ca href=\\\"/u/kn0thing\\\"\\u003Eu/kn0thing\\u003C/a\\u003E), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\\u2019s done for us over the years.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I\\u0026#39;d like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\\u20132006, our idealistic \\u201cpolicy\\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3\\\"\\u003Ebanned racist users\\u003C/a\\u003E anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \\u201cpolicy.\\u201d \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left Reddit from 2010\\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\\u2019s no-removal policy \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/\\\"\\u003Eossified\\u003C/a\\u003E and its content policy took \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/\\\"\\u003Eno position on hate\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/CoonTown\\\"\\u003Er/CoonTown\\u003C/a\\u003E, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\\u2019s not. \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/\\\"\\u003EWe banned that community and others\\u003C/a\\u003E because they were \\u201cmaking Reddit worse\\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy\\\"\\u003E2015 policy\\u003C/a\\u003E around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/\\\"\\u003E2017\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/\\\"\\u003E2018\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/\\\"\\u003E2019\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/\\\"\\u003E2020\\u003C/a\\u003E (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/\\\"\\u003Eracism is not against the rules, but also isn\\u2019t welcome on Reddit\\u003C/a\\u003E. This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with \\u003Ca href=\\\"/r/the_donald\\\"\\u003Er/the_donald\\u003C/a\\u003E, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord.

The reason we\\u2019re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.\\n\\nAs Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit\\u2014or at least say on our public pages\\u2014in the spirit of our mission.\\n\\nThese types of content are prohibited [1]:\\n\\n * Spam\\n * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)\\n * Publication of someone\\u2019s private and confidential information\\n * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say \\\"I don't like this group of people.\\\" It's not ok to say, \\\"I'm going to kill this group of people.\\\")\\n * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]\\n * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors\\n\\nThere are other types of content that are specifically classified:\\n\\n * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.\\n * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.\\n\\nWe've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don\\u2019t pollute people\\u2019s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor\\u2019s listings, and we think it\\u2019ll work for this other type of content as well. \\n\\nNo company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We\\u2019ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don\\u2019t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it\\u2019s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.\\n\\n[1] This is basically what we have right now. I\\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.\\n\\n[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this \\\"Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.\\\"\\n\\nedit: added an example to clarify our concept of \\\"harm\\\"\\nedit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy\\n\\nupdate: I'm out of here, everyone.
