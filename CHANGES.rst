Change Log
==========

Async PRAW follows `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

Unreleased
----------

**Added**

- Add support for Python 3.13.
- Add support for optional Markdown-formatted ``selftext`` when submitting link, image,
  gallery and video posts.
- Support delayed session creation in asyncprawcore 2.5.0+.
- Add parameter ``fetch`` to :meth:`.get_rule` to control whether to fetch the rule data
  when initializing the rule object.

**Changed**

- Bumped asyncprawcore to 3.0.2.
- Drop support for Python 3.8, which was end-of-life on 2024-10-07.
- Change ``Reddit.user.me`` to raise :class:`.ReadOnlyException` when called in
  :attr:`.read_only` mode.

  must now be passed by keyword.
- The ``flair_type`` argument to :class:`.SubredditFlairTemplates` must be passed by

  mutually exclusive. When ``url`` is provided ``selftext`` will be used as optional
  body text to accompany the link submission. An exception is raised when trying to use
  ``inline_media`` with ``selftext`` for a ``url`` submission because Reddit does not
  support inline media in body text for link submissions.

  :meth:`.Subreddit.submit_image` now accept an optional Markdown-formatted ``selftext``
  parameter.

- The keyword argument ``lazy`` has been replace by ``fetch`` to consolidate the keyword
  argument used to explicitly perform a fetch when initializing an object.

  now a positional-only argument.
- The ``short_name`` argument in :meth:`.get_rule` is now a positional-only argument.
- The ``update_id`` argument in :meth:`.get_update` has been replaced with ``id`` and is
  now a positional-only argument.

  - :meth:`.get_emoji`
  - :meth:`.get_reason`
  - :meth:`.get_update`
  - :meth:`.DraftHelper.__call__`
  - :meth:`.LiveHelper.__call__`

7.8.1 (2024/12/21)
------------------

**Changed**

- Bump asyncprawcore minimum version.

7.8.0 (2024/10/20)
------------------

**Added**

- :meth:`~.SubredditLinkFlairTemplates.reorder` to reorder a subreddit's link flair
  templates.
- :meth:`~.SubredditRedditorFlairTemplates.reorder` to reorder a subreddit's redditor
  flair templates.
- Experimental :meth:`~.Submission._edit_experimental` for adding new inline media or
  editing a submission that has inline media.

  .. danger::

      This method is experimental. It is reliant on undocumented API endpoints and may
      result in existing inline media not displaying correctly and/or creating a
      malformed body. Use at your own risk. This method may be removed in the future
      without warning.

  This method is identical to :meth:`.Submission.edit` except for the following:

  - The ability to add inline media to existing posts.
  - Additional ``preserve_inline_media`` keyword argument to allow Async PRAW to attempt
    to preserve the existing inline media when editing a post. This is an experimental
    fix for an issue that occurs when editing a post with inline media would cause the
    media to lose their inline appearance.

- :func:`.stream_generator` now accepts the ``continue_after_id`` parameter, which
  starts the stream after a given item ID.
- Support for new share URL format created from Reddit's mobile apps.
- :class:`.Reddit` has a new configurable parameter, ``window_size``. This tells PRAW
  how long reddit's rate limit window is. This defaults to 600 seconds and shouldn't
  need to be changed unless reddit changes the size of their rate limit window.

**Fixed**

- An issue where submitting a post with media would fail due to an API change.

**Changed**

- Drop support for Python 3.7, which is end-of-life on 2023-06-27.

**Fixed**

- XML parsing error when media uploads fail.

7.7.1 (2023/07/11)
------------------

**Changed**

- Drop ``asyncio_extras`` dependency, use ``contextlib.asynccontextmanager`` instead.

**Fixed**

- An issue with replying to a modmail conversation results in a error.

7.7.0 (2023/02/25)
------------------

**Added**

- :meth:`.delete_mobile_banner` to delete mobile banners.
- :meth:`.upload_mobile_banner` to upload mobile banners.

**Fixed**

- An issue with iterating :class:`.ModNote` when a user has more than a hundred notes.
- An issue when uploading media during the submission of a new media post.
- Removal reasons are now returned in the same order as they appear on Reddit.

7.6.1 (2022/11/28)
------------------

**Changed**

- Revert :meth:`~.Comment.edit` positional argument deprecation.
- Revert :meth:`~.Submission.edit` positional argument deprecation.

**Fixed**

- An issue where :class:`.ModmailConversation`'s ``messages`` attribute would only
  contain the latest message.

7.6.0 (2022/10/23)
------------------

**Added**

- :meth:`.pin` to manage pinned submissions on the authenticated user's profile.
- :meth:`.update_display_layout` to update the display layout of posts in a
  :class:`.Collection`.

  specifying a display layout when creating a :class:`.Collection`.
- :attr:`~.Message.parent` to get the parent of a :class:`.Message`.
- :class:`.ModNote` to represent a moderator note.
- :meth:`.ModNote.delete` to delete a single moderator note.
- :class:`.RedditModNotes` to interact with moderator notes from a :class:`.Reddit`
  instance. This provides the ability to create and fetch notes for one or more
  redditors from one or more subreddits.
- :class:`.RedditorModNotes` to interact with moderator notes from a :class:`.Redditor`
  instance.
- :meth:`.RedditorModNotes.subreddits` to obtain moderator notes from multiple
  subreddits for a single redditor.

  :class:`.Submission`.
- :meth:`~.ModNoteMixin.author_notes` to view the moderator notes for the author of a

- Positional keyword arguments for applicable functions and methods. Starting with Async
  PRAW 8, most functions and methods will no longer support positional arguments. It
  will encourage more explicit argument passing, enable arguments to be sorted
  alphabetically, and prevent breaking changes when adding new arguments to existing
  methods.

------------------

**Added**

- Log a warning if a submission's ``comment_sort`` attribute is updated after the

  argument used to explicitly perform a fetch when initializing an object.

**Fixed**

- Fixed return value type of methods returning a listing in :class:`.Subreddit` and its
  helper classes.
- An import error when using Async PRAW in environments where ``libsqlite3-dev`` is

7.3.1 (2021/07/06)

  ``asyncprawcore.Session`` (more specifically, :py:class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`)
  does not support being deepcopied.

  ``"None"``.

7.3.0 (2021/06/18)
------------------

**Added**

- :class:`.UserSubreddit` for the ``subreddit`` attribute of :class:`.Redditor`.

**Fixed**

- Fixed bug where :meth:`.WikiPage.edit` and :meth:`.SubredditWiki.create` would fail if
  passed ``content`` and ``reason`` parameters that produced a request with a body
  greater than 500 KiB, even when the parameters did not exceed their respective
  permitted maximum lengths.
- Fixed bug where :meth:`.request` could not handle instances of ``BadRequest``\ s when
  the JSON data contained only the keys "reason" and "message".

------------------

**Added**

- :class:`.Reddit` keyword argument ``token_manager``.
- ``FileTokenManager`` and its parent abstract class ``BaseTokenManager``.

**Deprecated**

- The configuration setting ``refresh_token`` is deprecated and its use will result in a
  :py:class:`DeprecationWarning`. This deprecation applies in all ways of setting
  configuration values, i.e., via ``praw.ini``, as a keyword argument when initializing
  an instance of :class:`.Reddit`, and via the ``PRAW_REFRESH_TOKEN`` environment
  variable. To be prepared for Async PRAW 8, use the new :class:`.Reddit` keyword
  argument ``token_manager``. See :ref:`refresh_token` in Async PRAW's documentation for
  an example.
- ``Reddit.user.me`` will no longer return ``None`` when called in :attr:`.read_only`
  mode starting in Async PRAW 8. A :py:class:`DeprecationWarning` will be issued. To

  which will change the order in which elements are removed from the set.
- Improved :meth:`~.Subreddit.submit_image` and :meth:`~.Subreddit.submit_video`
  performance in slow network environments by removing a race condition when
